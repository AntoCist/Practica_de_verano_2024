* **hub_data.txt:** Observational data of the Hubble parameter ordered by redshift (z).
* **lcparam_full_long.txt:** Observational data obtained from [Pantheon](https://github.com/dscolnic/Pantheon). A table of key parameters retrieved from the light curve fits for the entire Pantheon sample. [Pantheon](https://github.com/dscolnic/Pantheon).
* **Datos_hub_data.ipynb:** Plots of $D_L$ and $H(z)$ obtained from the hub_data.txt data and their agreement with the theoretical equation.
* **Datos_lcparam_full_long.ipynb:** Plots with the $D_L$ and $H(z)$ data obtained from lcparam_full_long.txt data and their agreement with the theoretical equation.
* **GA.ipynb:** Genetic algorithm developed from base functions and operators.
* **GA_sympy.ipynb:** Copy of GA.ipynb but with fitness function calculation using sympy expressions.
* **GA_class.ipynb:** Genetic algorithm developed using the 'individual' and 'population' classes
